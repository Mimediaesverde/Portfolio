          <p>Who am I? Good question, I keep asking myself the same thing to this day. 
            <br><br>
            But what I can tell you for sure is that I was born in Peru, the country of the best dishes and memes. Seriously, just look at their news. 
            <br><br>
            About work? Well, I started working in advertising as a Copywriter in 2015. In all those years I've had successes and also some small, big and gigantic mistakes. All of them led me to leave my country, my home, my dog and cat in search of something else, what else? That's another good question. 
            <br><br>
            In the meantime, another sure thing I can say is that there will be no shortage of great ideas. Or good time, same thing.
            <br><br>
            So, you can contact me in the "contact" section when I finally figure out how I can create the "contact" section.

          <h2>EQUALITY LOANS</h2>
          <p>The gender pay gap between men and women is still a latent problem in the world.  It is estimated that it would take 105 years to bridge that gap. Bankinter wanted to help reduce that time. This loan that you can pay back in 105 years, aimed at entrepreneurial women and businesses that commit to provide a fair salary among their workers.  That way, they’ll have no excuse. We’ll host a landing page where all the necessary information regarding how to access and manage loans will be available, as well as a pay gap meter which we hope will reach zero soon.</p>

          <h2>BULLYINGPROOF</h2>
          <p>More than 60% of school students still suffer from bullying. Jockey Plaza wanted to address this situation in the back-to-school season.
            <br>Jockey Plaza created a collection that is ideal both for kids and young students and put them “on sale”. These items caused outrage among parents, but also got schools to commit to including methods against bullying in their curricula.
