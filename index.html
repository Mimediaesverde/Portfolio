          <p>Who am I? Good question, I keep asking myself the same thing to this day. 
            <br><br>
            But what I can tell you for sure is that I was born in Peru, the country of the best dishes and memes. Seriously, just look at their news. 
            <br><br>
            About work? Well, I started working in advertising as a Copywriter in 2015. In all those years I've had successes and also some small, big and gigantic mistakes. All of them led me to leave my country, my home, my dog and cat in search of something else, what else? That's another good question. 
            <br><br>
            In the meantime, another sure thing I can say is that there will be no shortage of great ideas. Or good time, same thing.
            <br><br>
            So, you can contact me in the "contact" section when I finally figure out how I can create the "contact" section.

          <h2>EQUALITY LOANS</h2>
          <p><br>The gender pay gap between men and women is still a latent problem in the world. It is estimated that it would take 105 years to bridge that gap. 
            <br><br>Bankinter wanted to help reduce that time. This loan that you can pay back in 105 years, aimed at entrepreneurial women and businesses that commit to provide a fair salary among their workers. That way, they'll have no excuse. 
            <br><br>We'll host a landing page where all the necessary information regarding how to access and manage loans will be available, as well as a pay gap meter which we hope will reach zero soon.</p>

            <br><br>Jockey Plaza created a collection that is ideal both for kids and young students and put them “on sale”. 
            <br><br>These items caused outrage among parents, but also got schools to commit to including methods against bullying in their curricula.

            <br><br>How can Multiópticas, an eyewear store, make young people get their eyes tested? Playing of course. 
            <br><br>We'll create a new firearm, a sniper rifle, with a scope with variable magnification, and we'll link it to some of the most popular shooters like Call of Duty, Fortnite and Counter-Strike. 
            When you download this rifle, you'll try it out in a tutorial with small targets and short missions.  When the tutorial is over, you'll see your score and your eye test results, showing you if you might need to visit the eye doctor.

That's why, in order to promote the next edition of the Festival Internacional de cine fantàstic de Catalunya in Sitges, Barcelona, we'll make an ending that nobody will be able to refuse, because it will be their creation. 
            <br><br>30 Monedas is a Spanish horror/fiction series quite popular in the region.  Through a series of stories on Instagram, we’ll gradually put together an alternative ending for the series with the fans' assistance. 
            <br><br>We'll re-edit the ending following this new version and it will premiere at the festival, where great directors and actors will be able to enjoy it.
